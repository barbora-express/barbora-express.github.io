# Authentication

We have two authentication methods. 

1. User authentication. JWT token

<!-- // TODO: There is no way to create access token. Using dashboard -->
<!-- 2. Access token. You can obtain access token in dashboard itself -->

2. Authentication token

In case of JWT token `organization` header should be present
