Use same user login credentials for production and testing environments in Self Service. Organizations in testing and production are separate entities.
First time logging into testing environment you will be asked to create new organization that will be used for testing purposes. Please note that there are no actual couriers in testing environment, but order lifecycle can be simulated by Barbora Express team, please contact your sales representative to arrange that.

> Only login credentials are shared across multiple environments
